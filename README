= Master and slaves management =

Let's start with an example. First create all the slaves

    fab slave.create

Then create the master

    fab master.create

Finally run the master and the slaves

    fab master.run slave.run

All done!

It's possible to run commands on one slave only. For example

fab slave.start:hosts=buildbot@bs-jessie-amd64.local

For more advanced usage see the fabric documentation
http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.5/usage/fab.html

= Slave requirements =

* buildbot user with passwordless, ttyless sudo access.
* ssh access with public key authentication
* git, virtualenv, gcc, make, python development

= Creating a kvm slave =

You can create an image with something like this:

    virt-install \
        --name buildslave-foo --ram 512 --disk \
        path=/srv/images/buildslave-foo.img,bus=virtio,size=10 \
        -network network:default \
        --location "http://mirror.foo.com/..." \
        --extra-args="text serial console=ttyS0,115200"

= GitHub WebHooks =

For our modules (dnaravez user and sugarlabs organization), we are using WebHooks. You can set them up in
each module settings, the url is

= Bug reports =

Send bug reports to Daniel Narvaez <dwnarvaez@gmail.com>.
